## **Content-Based Recommendation System & AI-Driven Storyteller**

This repository contains two separate NLP-based AI projects:

1. **Content-Based Recommendation System**
2. **AI-Driven Storyteller**

Both projects demonstrate AI applications in personalization, text processing, and generative storytelling.

# 🧠 Project 1: Content-Based Recommendation System

## 📘 Overview
A simple yet effective recommendation engine that suggests similar items using **TF-IDF** and **Cosine Similarity**.  
It works purely based on content features—no user history required.

## 🔍 Features
- NLP-based text preprocessing  
- TF-IDF vectorization  
- Cosine similarity ranking  
- Lightweight and scalable  
- Works for movies, products, articles, books, etc.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python  
- Scikit-Learn  
- NumPy / Pandas  
- NLTK (optional)

# project 2:🎨 AI Dugran Story Generator

An AI system that generates creative and coherent stories based on user prompts, such as themes, genres, or characters.  
It uses a **Transformer-based language model** to produce structured narratives automatically.

---

## 📘 Overview
The AI Dugran Story Generator accepts user inputs and generates engaging, human-like stories.  
It produces structured stories with a logical flow: **Introduction → Conflict → Climax → Resolution**.

This project demonstrates the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and generative AI for creative applications.
